Hi There!!!
You're viewing my work profile showcasing my recent contributions to the veradigm codebases.

IYKYK...otherwise, let's get to know me.
I'm a Expert Software Engineer at Veradigm. Been in the company since last 5 years and going on...

I likes to read and write code, talk about algorithms, designs, patterns and architectures.
Versed with C#, JS/TS, Python, SQL...won't bore you with this list... :D

You got something there for me? slip in a DM on slack/teams! Ciao!!!
(Alexa, play the soulful track)...
